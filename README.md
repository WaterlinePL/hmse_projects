# HMSE - projects submodule

This repository stores submodule used in [HMSE-frontend](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/HMSE-frontend) to gain access to 
projects and modify them. Each HMSE deployment uses different branch:
* [`desktop`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_projects/tree/desktop) - desktop deployment
* [`docker`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_projects/tree/docker) - docker deployment
* [`k8s`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_projects/tree/k8s) - Kubernetes deployment

The [`main`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_projects/tree/main) branch is used as common interface for all the 
deployments.

Each of these are used in the related branch on the frontend.
